# `kube-webhook-wrapper`

The `kube-webhook-wrapper` is a wrapper you can use with your
`kubebuilder` generated project. It is able to register webhooks
automatically in an existing Kubernetes cluster.

Ideally, this project will be used along with a `k3d` or `kind`
environment, so you can run your controller in the host, while
webhooks are registered against the containerized Kubernetes cluster
in an automatic fashion, for development only. In this mode, the
wrapper will take care of:

- Generate a certificate authority and server certificate
- Register the webhook endpoint in the local HTTP server exposed by
  Kubeuilder (this is done by Kubebuilder by default as well)
- Register webhooks in the API server, so `AdmissionRequests` will
  flow from the containerized API server to the controller running in
  the host (using the defined `Host` and `Port` in `ctrl.Options`).

The development mode is opt-in, and if it's not enabled explicitly,
the behavior of `kube-webhook-wrapper` will be the same as the
original code generated by `kubebuilder`.
